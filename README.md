# THE FINAL STEPS TO RUN WHAT WE CREATE:
1. run the docker file from the directory containes the Dockerfile:
    `docker-compose up --build`
    it will reach to the point of running the server
    and run 2 containers: 
        - whatsonme_web_1
        - whatsonme_db_1
2. to create a superuser:
    -stop the containers:
        `docker-compose down`
    - create the superuser:
        `docker-compose run web python /code/manage.py createsuperuser`
        fill...
    then:
    `docker-compose up --build`
    will auto migrate and run the server



# ADD THE MAKE FILE ;)
if not available on the system:
`brew install make`

the available orders:

1. `make start`
    start the container 

2. `make stop`
    stop the container 

3. `make restart`
    restart the container

4. `make superuser`
    create the superuser for the project

5. `make db`
    connect to the database psql




# transfor the model data into API

### Using Django Rest Framework:
 - Serializer: transform the data into JSON

 1. add the `djangorestframework` to the Pipfile to install it.
    the problem is the Pipfile will install it but didn't update the Pipfile.lock
    to solve this but i think it is not the right way:
        insert this line in Dockerfile to install djangorestframework then the .lock file will be updated
        `RUN pipenv install djangorestframework`
 2. add `rest_framework` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py
 3. create `serializers.py` file inside the app (auth_api)
 4. using Django RESTful Framework generic views instead of custom views and template because it is just API and they are pre-built views
 5. update `auth_api/views.py` to include generic views and create list_view and details_view
 6. the project's url point to the auth_api path
 7. update the app url 
 8. the API supports CRUD


# Try to add redis

## Use Django built-in auth app
### Using this app as users for login/logout
- The path will be /users/home, /users/login
1. modify the project urls.py file to include 
    `path('users/', include(django.contrib.auth.urls))`
2. create template folder and  inside of it registration folder that will including the teplates for the users view urls
3. the login.html template will include the login template `{{ form.as_p }}`
4. add the path to the templates folder in the setttings file
5. add `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'` to redirect the success login to
6. create basic, home pages to login logout and modify the login template that will extend the base page
7. in the url.py we will use the generic.base template and connect our home page with it


### Using this app as users for register(sign-up)
- now we need to create view and url so we create an app for that (users)
1. create a new app (users)
    `docker-compose exec web /usr/local/bin/python3 manage.py startapp users`
2. add urls.py to the app
3. include the app in the settings installed apps
4. point to the app in the project urls.py
    add the path above the built in path that created for login/out that it will go the first path appeared (because they have the same path name 'users/')
5. in the views:    
    '''
    Using reverse_lazy instead of reverse? The reason is that for all generic class-based views the urls are not loaded when the file is imported, so we have to use the lazy form of reverse to load them later when theyâ€™re available.
    '''
6. create the template for signup (signup.html)
7. to signup go to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/users/signup/`








## Start from 0
1. Create environment: terminal
	`pipenv --python 3.7`
    `pipenv shell` enter the virtual environment
2. That will create Pipfile file containing:
		'''
            [[source]]
            name = "pypi"
            url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
            verify_ssl = true

            [dev-packages]

            [packages]

            [requires]
            python_version = "3.7"
        '''
3. add django to Pipfile under [requires]:
    django = "==2.2.0"
4. `pipenv install` that install the required packaches
5. Create django project:
    `django-admin startproject whatsonme`
6. ???????? not worked until:
    `pipenv install django`
7. migrate database the basic:
    `python manage.py migrate`
8. run the server:
    `python manage.py runserver`
9. Create the app: "auth_app"
    `python manage.py startapp auth_api`
    install `psycopg2` for database bindings to PostgreSQL

Put the project on Docker:
10. Change to postgres db:
11. change the settings to use the postgres:
    '''
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'postgres',
            'USER': 'postgres',
            'HOST': 'db', # will take from docker-compose.yml
            'PORT': 5432
        }
    }
    '''


....etc
